This report represents the design and implementation details of cache and main memory of 2-level memory hierarchy simulator.
Two different cache types are developed -direct mapped and fully associative.

Name of source code files
1)memory.cpp
2)naive6.cpp
3)naive16.cpp
4)naiv25.cpp
5)smart6.cpp
6)smart16.cpp
7)smart25.cpp
8)memory.h

Note: The program can be compiled and run for each and every code seperately.

The code has to be run a couple of times after compilation untill the code prints the entire output.
